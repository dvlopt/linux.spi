# dvlopt.linux.spi

Certain linux systems expose
[SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus) channels as
devices.

This clojure library aims to provide a simple interface for talking to slave SPI
devices.

## Usage

For the time being, this library is very much an experiment.

Read source, autogen documentation with codox, and try it out. We recommend the
Raspberry Pi for doing so.
